                        Engaged in academic research on combinatorics mathematics applied to cryptography.
                        I explore combinatorial designs in group testing, specifically constructions of Cover-Free Families (CFFs), 
                        focusing on polynomial constructions over finite fields and exploring other designs. 
                        My work addresses both the theoretical aspects—generalizing and proposing new designs—and their efficient implementation in C.

                        A high-performance C implementation of unbounded Cover-Free Families (CFFs) based on polynomial constructions over finite fields. 
                        This project focuses on implementing both embedding families and monotone families of CFFs. 
                        The implementation employs an optimized strategy of pre-calculating polynomial evaluations and storing them in a nested hash map to efficiently build the CFF binary matrix, a technique referred to as inverted indexes. 
                        Additionally, a paper has been produced generalizing the construction of the embedding family and detailing this practical implementation.
